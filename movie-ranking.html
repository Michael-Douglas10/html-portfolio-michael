<h1>The Best Movies According to Michael</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Grown Ups</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie by Adam Sandaler, it highlights how adults still need to have fun and the contrast between older and newer generations.</p>
<h3>After</h3>
<p>I think Harden is a insperational charactor in the movie.</p>
<h3>Hunger Games</h3>
<p>The hunger games is a destopian world which is quite cool I find.</p>
